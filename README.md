### Hi there 👋 I'm Francesca!
I’m currently studing the big world of Software Engineering and It Management at University of Salerno to achieve the master's degree in Computer Science. I like programming, cycling, discovering new places and at last but not least I like writing README files 😁. I hope you can seek inspiration in my repositories. If you want, you can reach me on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesca-perillo-671939199/). 

Have a good life 🍀!
